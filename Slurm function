slurm_make_time_str - convert time_t to formatted string for user output ///src/common/parse_time.c

 * The format depends on the environment variable SLURM_TIME_FORMAT, which may
 * be set to 'standard' (fallback, same as if not set), 'relative' (format is
 * relative to today's date and optimized for space), or a strftime(3) string.
 *
 * IN time - a time stamp
 * OUT string - pointer user defined buffer
 * IN size - length of string buffer, we recommend a size of 32 bytes to
 *	easily support different site-specific formats
