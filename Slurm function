slurm_make_time_str - convert time_t to formatted string for user output ///src/common/parse_time.c

 * The format depends on the environment variable SLURM_TIME_FORMAT, which may
 * be set to 'standard' (fallback, same as if not set), 'relative' (format is
 * relative to today's date and optimized for space), or a strftime(3) string.
 *
 * IN time - a time stamp
 * OUT string - pointer user defined buffer
 * IN size - length of string buffer, we recommend a size of 32 bytes to
 *	easily support different site-specific formats

 job_req_node_filter - job reqeust node filter.///src/slurmctld/node_scheduler.c
 
   *	clear from a bitmap the nodes which can not be used for a job
   *	test memory size, required features, processor count, etc.
   * NOTE: Does not support exclusive OR of features.
   *	It just matches first element of XOR and ignores count.
   * IN job_ptr - pointer to node to be scheduled
   * IN/OUT bitmap - set of nodes being considered for use
   * RET SLURM_SUCCESS or EINVAL if can't filter (exclusive OR of features)
